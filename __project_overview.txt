Introduction

This projet solves/simplifies some common problems encountered with customer sales.
Namely:
    - marketing
    - service sales
    - product sales
    - logistics
    - customer communication 

Project strategy:
Conceptualy the system will follow the same logical structure as a mall.
i.e. 
there will be a mall that creates and maintains stores and cutomers
there will be stores that manages and comunicates with customers
there will be customers that can interact in various ways with stores/shops

Now I will outline the overall implementation of the project

On this system there will be three different entities namely 
    - admin 
    - shop 
    - customer
responsibilities of these entities will be as follow:
admin
    - will act as a wizard for setting up the mall framework 
    - crud operations on all the entities on the system
shop
    - social media module
    - products module
    - services module
    - logistics module
    - communication module
    - payment module
customer
    - order products and services 
    - communicate with the mall/admin and with stores
