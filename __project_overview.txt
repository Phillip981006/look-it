Introduction

Namely:
    - marketing

Project strategy:
Conceptualy the system will follow the same logical structure as a mall.
i.e. 
there will be a mall that creates and maintains stores and cutomers
there will be stores that manages and comunicates with customers
there will be customers that can interact in various ways with stores/shops
